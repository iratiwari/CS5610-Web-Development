                <p>  I enjoyed CS5610 - Web Development very much, got
                to learn so much about different web technologies right from HTML5 , CSS , Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery,
                AngularJS etc. to ASP.NET , SQL , Entity frameworks. I hope to some day become a web applications developer
                and get the opportunity to work on these technologies on a daily basis.</p>

                <p> I thank <b>Prof. Jose Annunziato </b>for being a great mentor and teacher. His lectures were always interesting
                to attend and the availability of the entire content on youtube made it really easy to access all course
                videos and clear my basic doubts. He always patiently listened to and answered any queries I had and did so 
                with a smile. It has been a great experience learning from you! </p>

                <p>I thank my TA <b>Sneha Vankireddy </b>for all her help. She helped me setup all the softwares required for this course,
                and explained all that needed to be done at the beginning of the course. Her continuous feedback helped me improve and 
                rectify my mistakes. Thank you Sneha! </p>

                <p>I also thank <b>Prof. Rasala </b> for providing all students the course website about CS5610. It was a first for me to be able
                to see the entire class's content and also to see all previous years students' websites. It was of great help. 
                I particularly was fascinated by the story utility in the course,it is such an easy way to organize all our experiments!
