<h3>Week 7 Blog</h3>
<p>
    I experimented with web API's this week. I implemented the following experiments this week:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Experimenting with Google Maps API</li>
<p>
    In this experiment, I implemented google maps API. You can input either the zip code or address to view
    the location.
</p><br />
<li>2. Experimenting with a weather API</li>
<p>
    In this experiment, I created a Weather app using weather API. If you type the name of a city in the input
    box below, the result displays current, today's and the next day's predicted weather conditions.</p><br />
 <li>3. Experimenting with a movies API</li>
<p>
    In this experiment, I have a pre-defined database of movies. We can add new movies, remove existing movies from the database.
</p><br/>
    <li>4. Experimenting with a Movies API , extended</li>
<p>In this experiment, I  used IMDB API to get movie details. Once we enter a movie title in the search bar, details of that
    movie is fetched from imdb database and displayed. We can then add the movies to favorites list, edit a movie or delete it from
    the listed set of movies.</p><br/>
    <li>5. Experimenting with a movies API with details</li>
<p>In this experiment, I continued with the previous experiment, favorites and Details heading
            gets displayed only when a movie is added to favorites list and details button is clicked, respectively.
        </p><br />
    </ul>
