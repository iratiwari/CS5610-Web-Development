                          is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that 
                          are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, 
                          because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some 
                          great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to 
                          obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure 
                          that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

        <h4>About the Experiment</h4>
        <p>
            In this experiment, I learned about headers and footers on a page and adding a section tag on the page. Clicking on the "Top" link in each comment will take you
            to the top of the page, clicking on the Comments at the top will take you to the comments section of the page and clicking on
            the footer link at the top will take you to the page footer. I also used bootstrap to make the experiment look more presentable.
