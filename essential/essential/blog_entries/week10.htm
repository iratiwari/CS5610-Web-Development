<h3>Week 10 Blog</h3>
<p>
    I implemented eperiments for my project in this week. I implemented the following experiments :
</p>
<ul>
       <li>1. Demo for retrieving data from an API</li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I performed a search for 'Harry Potter' in Google Books API and displayed the top 10 results. The data
        from the google books API is in JSON format.</p><br/>
<li>2. Project Home page demo</li>
    <p> This experiment shows the basic rendering of the homepage of my project.
    </p> <br/>
       <li>3. Searching for a book - demo</li>
    <p>
        In this experiment I learned about the retrieval of data from an API. The first 10 search results from Google books
        API were displayed along with the book image and author name.
