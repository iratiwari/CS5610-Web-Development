                    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
                    but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
                    Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
                    occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
                    example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
                    any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids
                    a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
