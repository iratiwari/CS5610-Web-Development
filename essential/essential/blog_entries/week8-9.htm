<h3>Week 8 and 9 Blog</h3>
<p>
    I experimented with ASP.NET. I did the experiments following professor Jose's video lectures.
    I implemented the following experiments :
</p>
<p><ul>
       <li>1. First page in ASP.NET</li>
    <p>
    In this experiment , I made the first basic page of ASP.NET.
</p><br/>
       <li>2. Embedding C# code in an ASP.NET page</li>
<p>
    In this experiment , I embeds C# code into an ASPX page.</p> <br/>
    <li>3. Using dynamic loops in C#</li>
<p>
    In this experiment , I  learned to implement a dynamic loop for displaying an array of courses.</p><br/>
    <li>4. Using dynamic tables in ASP.NET</li>
<p>
    In this experiment, I  learned to implement a dynamic table for displaying an array of courses and their prices.
</p><br/>
    <li>5. Forms and input fields</li>
<p>
    In this experiment, I learned about implementing forms and input fields in .NET. The
    runat server element ensures that the value entered is stored at the server on clicking the button.
</p><br/>
    <li>6. Understanding Page Load</li>
<p>In this experiment , I learned about page loading in ASP.NET. The label "myLabel" is dynamically modified,
         it displays the total of an array of prices on page load.</p><br/>
    <li>7. Use of a button and on click function</li>
<p> In this experiment , I learned to implement an event handler for clicking.</p><br/>
    <li>8. Use of a textbox and an event handler</li>
<p>
    In this experiment, the use of a textbox and an event handler for clicking has been demonstrated.
    The label "messageLabel" is dynamically modified, it displays the text of the text typed in the textbox on clicking.
</p><br/>
    <li>9. A simple calculator in ASP.NET</li>
<p>In this experiment , A simple calculator was implemented
        by using what I learned to handle events on clicking buttons, and changing labels dynamically. </p> <br/>
    <li>10. Parsing parameters from a query string</li>
<p>In this experiment, I learned about the parsing of parameters in a query string. If you type ?message=*some text here* after .aspx at the title bar,
        you can see that this message is returned and displayed.</p><br/>
    <li>11. Demonstrating PostBack</li>
<p>In this experiment , I learned about the use of the IsPostBack flag in order to determine if the user has visited the page for the first time or not.</p><br/>
    <li>12. Sessions in ASP.NET</li>
<p>
    In this experiment , clicking on the remember button in this page will remember the text being entered
    in the textbox, and clicking on the forget button removes the text. This is done by creating event handlers
    for each button.
</p><br/>
    <li>13. A simple shopping cart demonstrating sessions</li>
<p>
    In this experiment, I learned to demonstrate sessions by displaying the values entered for a shopping cart.
</p><br/>
    </ul>
