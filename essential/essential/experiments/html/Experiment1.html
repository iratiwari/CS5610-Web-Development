                    <strong>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard </strong>
                            dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
                            scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
                       <del>in</del>to electronic typesetting, 
                            remaining essentially unchanged.
                            It was popularised <ins>in </ins> the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
                            sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                            including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
