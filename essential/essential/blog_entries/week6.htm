<h3>Week 6 Blog</h3>
<p>
    I learned AngularJS this week. I implemented the following experiments this week:
</p>
<p><ul>
       <li>1. Basics of AngularJS</li>
    <p>This experiment was performed to learn AngularJS basics. AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.
       The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the &lt;div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.</p><br />

       <li>2. Experimenting with filters in AngularJS</li>
<p>In this experiment I learned to use a filter in AngularJS.</p><br />

    <li>3. Experimenting with httprequest in AngularJS</li>
<p>
    In this experiment I learned to make an httprequest using AngularJS.
</p><br/>
    <li>4. Experimenting with tables in AngularJS</li>
<p>In this experiment I learned to implement tables using AngularJS. $http.get() reads static JSON data from http://www.w3schools.com/website/Customers_JSON.php.
            If it succeeds, the controller creates a property (names) in the scope, with JSON data from the server.
            This data is then displayed after applying styling to it. I have used  | orderBy : 'Country' to order the names
            by their country names.</p><br />

    <li>5. Experimenting with an application of AngularJS</li>
<p>
   In This experiment I learned to make and save a module in AngularJS and create an alert for the same.
</p> <br/>
    </ul>
